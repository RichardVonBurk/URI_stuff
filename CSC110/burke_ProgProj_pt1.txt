CSC 110 Programming Project Design

Airline Flight Scheduling

Project Description:
-----------------------
This program will take data from a file about flights from Providence to Orlando. 
Then it will prompt the user for them to pick an option from a displayed list.
After a task is completed, selected by the user, the options will be shown again until
the user selects the quit option.

General Solution:
------------------
The program will first take the data from the file and save what is read onto a map.
Then the opened file will be closed.
The program will then display options for the user and will wait for userinput.
Once an option is selected the appropriate function to that option will be called.
After that task is carried out then the list of options will appear again because it 
will be in a loop that is broken out of only if the option to quit was selected.
For every part that requires input the program will use exception handling.

Psuedocode/Main
----------------
main():
	extractData()
	isQuit = false
	while (isQuit == false):
		displayOptions()
		option = input("")
		if (option == 1):
			option1FuncCall
		elif (option == 2):
			option2FuncCall
		....
		....
		elif (quitoption):
			isQuit = true
		else:
			that option is not valid

Function Design
----------------
extractData(fileName):
	will read file and whiel reading will store info onto a map
	return map

displayOptions()
	prints out options for user

findFlight(Airliner, FlghtNum)
	searches for flight that fits both criteria
	return flightInfo

findCheaper(price)
	searches for every flight that is cheaper than price given
	return cheaper

calcDuration(depart, arrive)
	calculates duration of a flight
	return duration

findBefore(time)
	prints out each flight before specified time in 24hr system

findAvg(Airliner)
	calculates average cost of flights of given Airliner
	return average

sortByDepart()
	using mergesort, sorts flights by departure time
	prints out result
