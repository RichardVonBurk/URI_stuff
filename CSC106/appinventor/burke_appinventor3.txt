An app inventor list is a usage of the List Picker feature in User interface.
It is a way to organize and combine a set of things that can list of just about any block, 
in this case the texts blocks.
I used the lists feature by listing places from my home town using text blocks.
There was a correlating list that had the same amount of blocks that was a list of the Google.
Maps URLs.
Once the user picks a location from the list an activity starter selects the corresponding
URL in the other list which then brings the User the Map location.
